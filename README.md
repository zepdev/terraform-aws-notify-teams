# AWS Notify Microsoft Teams Terraform module

This module creates an SNS topic (or uses an existing one) and an AWS Lambda function that sends notifications to Microsoft Teams using the [Incoming Webhook Connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook).

Start by setting up an [incoming webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook#add-an-incoming-webhook-to-a-teams-channel) in your Microsoft Teams channel.

Doing serverless with Terraform? Check out [serverless.tf framework](https://serverless.tf), which aims to simplify all operations when working with the serverless in Terraform.


## Terraform versions

Terraform 0.13. Pin module version to `~> v4.0`. Submit pull-requests to `master` branch.

Terraform 0.12. Pin module version to `3.5.0` (or older). Submit pull-requests to `terraform012` branch.

Terraform 0.11. Pin module version to `~> v1.0`.

## Features

- [x] AWS Lambda runtime Python 3.6
- [x] Create new SNS topic or use existing one
- [ ] Support plaintext and encrypted version of Teams webhook URL
- [ ] Most of Teams message options are customizable
- [x] Support different types of SNS messages:
  - [x] AWS CloudWatch Alarms
  - [x] AWS CloudWatch LogMetrics Alarms
  - [ ] [Send pull-request to add support of other message types](https://github.com/teamclairvoyant/terraform-aws-notify-teams/pulls)
- [ ] Local pytest driven testing of the lambda to a Teams sandbox channel

## Usage

```hcl
module "notify_teams" {
  source  = "git::https://github.com/teamclairvoyant/terraform-aws-notify-teams.git?ref=tags/4.11.0.1"

  sns_topic_name = "teams-topic"

  teams_webhook_url = "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/AAA@BBB/IncomingWebhook/CCC/DDD"
}
```

## Upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0

Version 3 uses [Terraform AWS Lambda module](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-lambda) to handle most of heavy-lifting related to Lambda packaging, roles, and permissions, while maintaining the same interface for the user of this module after many of resources will be recreated.

## Using with Terraform Cloud Agents

[Terraform Cloud Agents](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/agent.html) are a paid feature, available as part of the Terraform Cloud for Business upgrade package.

This module requires Python 3.8. You can customize [tfc-agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/tfc-agent) to include Python using this sample `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM hashicorp/tfc-agent:latest
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get -y install python3.8 python3-pip
ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/tfc-agent"]
```

## Use existing SNS topic or create new

If you want to subscribe the AWS Lambda Function created by this module to an existing SNS topic you should specify `create_sns_topic = false` as an argument and specify the name of existing SNS topic name in `sns_topic_name`.

## Examples

* [notify-teams-simple](https://github.com/teamclairvoyant/terraform-aws-notify-teams/tree/master/examples/notify-teams-simple) - Creates SNS topic which sends messages to Teams channel.
* [cloudwatch-alerts-to-teams](https://github.com/teamclairvoyant/terraform-aws-notify-teams/tree/master/examples/cloudwatch-alerts-to-teams) - End to end example which shows how to send AWS Cloudwatch alerts to Teams channel and use KMS to encrypt webhook URL.

## Testing with pytest

To run the tests:

1. Set up a dedicated Teams channel as a test sandbox with it's own webhook. See [add an incoming webhook to a Teams channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook#add-an-incoming-webhook-to-a-teams-channel) for details.
2. Make a copy of the sample pytest configuration and edit as needed.

        cp functions/pytest.ini.sample functions/pytest.ini

3. Run the tests:

        pytest functions/notify_teams_test.py
